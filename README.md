# Project 3 : Port Scanner with Threading and Logging

## Description
A beginner-friendly **Port Scanner** built with Python that scans a range of ports on a given IP address or domain to check which ports are open or closed. It uses **multithreading** to speed up scanning and logs the results to a text file for later analysis.

## Features

- Scan a custom range of ports
- Fast scanning with multithreading
- Logs all open/closed ports to `scan_results.txt`
- User-friendly input prompts
- Works on both IPs and domain names


## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

- Takes user input for the target (IP/domain) and port range
- Scans each port in the range using separate threads
- For each port:
  - If it's open ‚Üí ‚úÖ printed to terminal and saved to `scan_results.txt`
  - If it's closed ‚Üí ‚ùå printed to terminal and saved to `scan_results.txt`
